## About

That Android Studio project is a ticket booking application that allows users to book tickets for various destinations. The app provides a user interface where users can enter their details such as destination, passenger name, departure, date of travel, and ticket type. The app calculates the ticket price based on the selected options and allows users to book the ticket.

Users can enter their datas on the booking page and book a ticket by clicking the "Book Ticket" button. The app calculates the ticket price based on the selected options and displays it on the screen.
Booked tickets are saved in a local SQLite database, and users can view their booked tickets on the home page.
Also, on the home page, users can delete a booking or view more details about a booking by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

Note: The app appears to be a prototype or sample project and may require further enhancements and error handling for a production-ready application.
